# Portable Humble Little Ruby Book
This book is a conversion of the [online version](http://humblelittlerubybook.com/). Many hours have gone into making this conversion as good as possible but there's still a little work to do! This book is currently being proof read on a Kindle 4.

## Formats
This version is currently provided in .mobi (compatible with Kindle devices) and .epub versions. The .pages file is simply the original source file from which I make the .epub file before converting it to .mobi with Calibre.

## Todo
* ~~Link table of contents with chapters~~
* ~~Add Peroration from PDF version~~
* ~~Add Appendix A from PDF version~~
* ~~Add Appendix B from PDF version~~
* ~~Fix code indentation for chapter 1~~
* ~~Fix code indentation for chapter 2~~
* ~~Fix code indentation for chapter 3~~
* Fix code indentation for chapter 4
* Fix code indentation for chapter 5
* Fix code indentation for chapter 6
